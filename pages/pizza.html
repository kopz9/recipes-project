  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Mozzarella pizza is amazing. Even more so, with pasta and homemade tomato sauce.</p>
  <p>Add some basil and invite the whole family to the table.</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 cups (tea) of wheat flour (about 840 g)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of instant dry yeast (about 20 g)</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
    <li>2½ cups (tea) of warm water</li>
    <li>¼ cup (tea) olive oil</li>
    <li>wheat flour to sprinkle the countertop</li>
    <li>olive oil to grease the bowl</li>    
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, mix the yeast and sugar. Add warm water and, using a spoon, mix well to dissolve. Leave at room temperature until foamy - about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer, mix the flour with the salt and make a well in the center. Set aside a bowl or other large container and grease it with 2 tablespoons of olive oil - it has to have enough space for the dough to rise a lot.</li>
    <li>Once it foams, pour the yeast mixture into the center of the bowl with flour. Add ¼ cup (tea) of olive oil and mix, with a spatula, just to combine.</li>
    <li>To knead the dough: fit the bowl onto the mixer with the hook; start beating at low speed for 5 minutes; gradually increase the speed to high and let it knead for another 15 minutes until a smooth dough forms - it will come away from the side of the bowl and form a ball on the mixer hook.</li>
    <li>Using your fingertips (or a spatula), loosen the dough from the mixer bowl and transfer it to the container greased with olive oil. Cover with film and let rest for 1 hour, until it rises and doubles in volume.</li>
    <li>When there are 30 minutes left to complete the dough's rising time, preheat the oven to 250 ºC (high temperature). If you are using a soapstone baking tray, place it in the oven while it is still cold to heat it from the beginning - otherwise it could crack due to the thermal shock.</li>
  </ol>
